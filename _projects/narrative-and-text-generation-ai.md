## Description
The "Narrative and Text Generation AI" activity engages students in a conversation about text generation AI, namely [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), in order to prompt a deeper conversation about narrative. As an assignment, students engage with a storytelling engine based on ChatGPT, [AI Dungeon](https://beta.aidungeon.com/). Then, in class, the instructor guides a conversation about the stories students experienced, the nature of the technology AI Dungeon relies on, and the ramifications such technology might have on what we consider to be narrative.
