## Description
<p><em>Genre generators</em> are text generators that use basic tools for using and manipulating text with a digital computer to create new instances of a written genre. The activity is intended for an undergraduate audience of students who may not know how to code, but would benefit from learning about the broader conceptual process of coding as a mediation between human goals/decisions, the world around us, and the strictures of digital technology. This activity was designed for the <em>TextGenEd</em> collection, so the links lead to the introduction and context written for the collection as well as the GitHub repositor containing the instructional materials that comprise the activity.</p>
