## Description
The "Personal Writing with AI" activity attempts to help students understand the writing process, how AI "writes," and how they might make use of AI in their own writing practice. It takes as a presupposition that such AI, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), are here to stay, and that instructors can and should speak to the role of the technology in the writing process rather than assume we can keep it out of student view into the future. While I recognize the value of writing without AI, which can only realistically be enforced with a return to in-class writing exams, I think that teaching students how to use this technology effectively is both more viable and potentially more fruitful for their own future work, where they will have access to these tools in whatever contexts they find themselves writing in as they continue their college and post-college careers.
